# Bail_Saarathi_RAG_LLM_Notebooks_Scripts

## Description
This repository hosts collaborative notebooks and Python scripts developed for the Bail Saarathi project, which leverages cutting-edge NLP and machine learning techniques to create an intelligent bail&amp;legal document retrieval &amp; analysis system. Key technologies include LangChain, ChromaDB, the Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro LLM, and Hugging Face Embeddings.

### Key Features
- **LangChain Integration:** 
  - Manages LLM workflows, including prompts, chains, and memory.
  
- **ChromaDB:** 
  - A high-performance vector database used for storing and querying document embeddings, powering the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.
  
- **LLM Model (Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro):**
  - A state-of-the-art language model tuned for legal language, used for summarization, question answering, and content generation.
  
- **Hugging Face Embeddings Model:**
  - Utilized for generating high-quality text embeddings, essential for tasks like semantic search and classification.

### Project Components
- **Collab Notebooks:**
  - Interactive notebooks demonstrating the implementation of the Bail Saarathi system, including data preprocessing, model training, and inference.

- **Python Scripts:**
  - Modular scripts designed for deployment and automation, handling tasks such as data ingestion, model inference, and API integration.

### Libraries and Technologies Used
- **LangChain:** Manages LLM workflows.
- **ChromaDB:** Vector database management and retrieval.
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro:** Primary language model for NLP tasks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Generates text embeddings.
- **Python:** Core programming language used across all components.

### Future Scope
The repository is under active development, with plans to expand the systemâ€™s capabilities to handle a broader range of legal tasks beyond bail procedures. Future updates will include enhanced model training pipelines, integration with external legal databases, and improved user interfaces for legal professionals.
